## Hello World

What's better than to start with a new language except a Hello World?

## What you will learn in this project:
- Importing header files using `#include`
- Printing something on terminal using `printf`

## Some other points:

- Every C program must have a `main` function which returns `int`.
The `main()` function is the function which is called just when the program starts
